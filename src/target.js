 *   memory   that memory file only; a NEW skill may still be extracted from it, and
 *            existing skills are read-only
 *   skill    that SKILL.md only; the memory file and every other skill are read-only
 *
 * Resolution is an exact match against the scope's configured memory-file entries
 * (after the same path normalization the scope applies) or a loaded skill's `name`.
 * Nothing else resolves: no basename, directory, glob, or arbitrary existing file.
 * A spec that matches nothing, or more than one thing, is an error that lists the
 * valid names. The target is a write surface, not a second scope: analysis, evidence,
 * and state are unchanged, only staging and the proposal gate narrow.
