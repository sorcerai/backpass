You are performing the synthesis step of a backward pass over a repository's agent
memory file. Evidence from many past agent sessions has already been gathered and
folded. Your job is to turn that evidence into a small set of concrete, budget-aware
edits - one gradient step on the weights, not a rewrite - by editing the file directly.

## Repository

{{REPO_NAME}} - {{TRANSCRIPT_COUNT}} sessions analyzed across {{HARNESS_SUMMARY}}.
{{RUN_NOTE}}

## Where you are

Your working directory is a staging copy, not the repository. It holds exactly two
things: the memory file at `./{{MEMORY_PATH}}` and the skills directory at
`./{{SKILLS_DIR}}/`. The repository itself is at `{{REPO_ROOT}}` - open any file there
to ground or verify an edit against the real code, but NEVER write there. Nothing you
change in the staging copy reaches the repository until a human reviews each change.

**Make your edits by editing `./{{MEMORY_PATH}}` in place with your file tools.** Do not
paste the edited text into your reply; backpass measures what you changed in the file.

## Current memory file: {{MEMORY_PATH}}

Budget: {{CURRENT_TOKENS}} / {{BUDGET_TOKENS}} estimated always-loaded tokens
({{BUDGET_STATE}}). {{BUDGET_COUNT}}

Every always-loaded token is paid on every future session, forever, and instruction
following dilutes as the file grows. The budget is the constraint you optimize under.

The index below is a lookup table, not the file: it names each instruction (`AG-nnn`,
or `AG-nnn.m` attribution parts for an oversized paragraph), its always-loaded cost,
and the lines it occupies in `./{{MEMORY_PATH}}`. The evidence refers to instructions
by these ids.

{{INSTRUCTION_INDEX}}

## Existing skills (load-on-trigger, in {{SKILLS_DIR}})

{{SKILL_INDEX}}

To extract a section into a skill, create `./{{SKILLS_DIR}}/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with
this exact shape, or append the extracted lines to an existing SKILL.md that should own
them, then remove the extracted detail from `./{{MEMORY_PATH}}`
(optionally leaving a one-line pointer):

```
---
name: <skill-name>
description: <one line - this IS the trigger condition>
---

<the full markdown body of the skill>
```

To tune an existing skill's trigger, edit its `description:` line under `./{{SKILLS_DIR}}/`.

## Folded evidence

`sessions` is how many distinct sessions produced the item. `relevance` is the share of
analyzed sessions in which an instruction drew any evidence at all, also split by
interactive vs non-interactive so a robot-heavy corpus cannot hide a category-specific
signal.

{{EVIDENCE}}

## Previously rejected edits - do not re-propose these

{{REJECTIONS}}

## Hard rules - a violation fails the whole proposal

{{TARGET_RULE}}1. **At most {{MAX_EDITS}} edits.** This is the learning rate. An edit is one change a
   human can decide on; pick the highest-signal ones. A small correct step beats a large
   speculative one.
2. **Every change to this always-loaded file needs evidence from at least
   {{MIN_GAP_EVIDENCE}} distinct sessions** - adding text, rewriting text and removing
   text alike, whatever the shape of the change. One bad session never rewrites the
   weights. Extracting text into a skill and moving text within the file are exempt:
   they keep every line. If only one session supports a wording change, leave the
   wording alone.
3. **Removing an instruction outright needs harm evidence from at least
   {{MIN_GAP_EVIDENCE}} distinct sessions** (`harm-sessions` in the evidence rows).
   Only `harm` negatives - following the instruction caused damage - argue against an
   instruction. `non-compliance` means it failed to steer: reinforce it, reposition it,
   or improve its trigger, never delete it for being ignored. Text you delete that does
   not land in a skill (created or extended) and does not reappear verbatim elsewhere in
   this file is a removal, whatever the edit is called - including text deleted from an
   existing skill file, where no evidence can attribute at all, so no skill-file deletion
   clears the floor: rewrite skill content, never remove it.
4. **An extraction preserves every line it removes** in the SKILL.md it creates or
   extends. Extending an existing skill keeps every line that file already had, then adds
   the extracted lines. A deletion is never part of an extract: it is its own `remove`
   edit, decided on its own evidence.
5. **A move's removed and added lines match one-for-one** in `./{{MEMORY_PATH}}`.
   Group the deletion and the re-add as one change. Do not duplicate, rewrite, or add a
   rule in order to "move" it.
6. **Every edit must be backed by at least one verbatim quote** from the evidence. You
   will attach the quotes in the next step, so only make changes you can back.
7. **Budget:** {{BUDGET_RULE}}
8. You can extract a long, narrow, crisply-triggered section instead of deleting it:
   extraction frees the same always-loaded tokens and loses nothing. You can extract into
   an existing skill when that file is the right home, instead of creating a new one.
9. Change only `./{{MEMORY_PATH}}` and files under `./{{SKILLS_DIR}}/`. Never delete a
   file. Do not create notes, scripts, or scratch files.
10. Do not assert or dramatize an agent's motives or intent beyond what the evidence
    supports.

## Where an instruction belongs

|                          | Trigger fits in one description line | Trigger not detectable |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Broad (>= 20% of sessions, or safety-critical) | memory file | memory file |
| Conditional / narrow     | **skill** (the description is the condition) | deletion candidate |

A skill's description is always loaded and its body is free until triggered, so moving a
section into a skill trades its always-loaded cost for that one description line. That
line is real budget: description tokens count toward the cap above, so keep descriptions
to one crisp trigger condition.

**Skill descriptions are weights too.** If the evidence shows an agent lacked knowledge
an existing skill already contains, that is a failed trigger: rewrite that skill's
description line instead of duplicating content in the memory file.

## When you are done

Reply with a short plain-text summary of what you changed and why (a few lines). No
JSON yet - backpass will measure the changes and ask you to annotate each one next.
If the evidence does not justify any change, change nothing and say so.
