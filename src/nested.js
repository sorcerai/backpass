/**
 * Nested memory files: a monorepo's per-directory weights.
 *
 * Memory in a monorepo is layered. The root file loads in every session, and a file such
 * as `apps/api/AGENTS.md` loads on top of it only when a session works under `apps/api/`.
 * Deeper files also load named ancestor files, outermost first.
 * A surface run trains every file named in `nestedMemoryFiles` as a weight of its own -
 * nothing is ever discovered, so what a run writes is always a file a human named:
 *
 *   evidence   only the sessions that worked under the file's directory, judged against
 *              that file with the root and named ancestor files shown as already loaded
 *   routing    a new instruction belongs to the most specific named file whose directory
 *              every session behind it worked in (`owningFile`); evidence that spans
 *              unrelated directories, or any session that cannot be placed, stays with
 *              the root file
 *   budget     each nested file has its own, `nestedBudgetTokens` (`budgetTokens` when unset)
 *   state      its own `.backpass/nested/<file>/` - evidence, gap ledger, prompts, staging -
 *              sharing only the rejections a human recorded at apply
 *
 * Where a session worked is deterministic: the paths its tool calls name in structured
 * fields (and the file headers of an apply_patch body), resolved against the checkouts
 * of this repository that discovery already knows. Paths outside known checkouts are
 * ignored: only in-repo paths define directory scope. A nested file trains only when
 * every in-repo work path stays under its subtree: editing apps/api/src/orders.ts and
 * reading README.md is cross-cutting and feeds only the root file. Without paths, its
 * cwd is used. Nothing is read out of shell command text. A session that ran on another machine,
 * or whose paths resolve to no known checkout, worked nowhere in particular and feeds
 * only the root file: a wrong attribution is worse evidence than none.
 *
 * With `nestedMemoryFiles` unset nothing here runs, and a run is exactly the
 * single-primary run it always was.
