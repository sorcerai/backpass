/**
 * Pre-synthesis gap consolidation: one bounded model call that sees the full open gap
 * set for the memory file and merges entries that are paraphrases of one gap.
 *
 * This is the second half of gap identity. The first half - the analysis turn citing an
 * existing gap id (`matchesGap`) - covers a sighting that arrives AFTER its partner is
 * already on the books. It cannot cover two sightings of a brand-new gap landing in the
 * same run's parallel fan-out: neither analysis saw the other's entry, so both coin one.
 * Consolidation runs after this run's observations are recorded and before the fold
 * clusters, so those same-run paraphrases still corroborate.
 *
 * Judgment is required here by design: word-bigram similarity cannot recognize a real
 * paraphrase (measured on a production ledger: 89 entries containing at least six
 * multi-session gaps, highest cross-session score 0.34 against the 0.45 bar). The model
 * is asked only "same gap or not", the merge itself is mechanical (`mergeGapEntries`),
 * unknown ids and malformed groups are dropped, and a session is never double-counted
 * however the entries merge. Strict admission is untouched: merging changes how
 * sightings line up, never how many distinct sessions a proposal needs.
 *
 * Exactly one call per run, and only when at least two entries exist. Failure is
 * fail-soft with a warning: the run degrades to lexical identity (the pre-consolidation
 * behavior), it never aborts - the next run re-judges the same open entries.
